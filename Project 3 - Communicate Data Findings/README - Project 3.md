# 📊 Data Visualization Project - Ford GoBike System Data

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project explores the importance of **data visualization** in the data analysis process. It consists of two parts:

1. **Exploratory Data Visualization** – Using Python visualization libraries (Matplotlib & Seaborn) to systematically explore a selected dataset, from single-variable distributions to multi-variable relationships.
2. **Explanatory Data Visualization** – Refining and designing clear, polished visualizations to effectively communicate key findings from the dataset.

## 📝 Objectives
By the end of this project, we aim to:
- Understand data distributions and relationships through **exploratory visualization**.
- Use **appropriate visualization techniques** for different types of data.
- Apply **design principles** to create effective and compelling visualizations.
- Present data insights in a clear and engaging manner.

## 🗂 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Ford GoBike System Data
