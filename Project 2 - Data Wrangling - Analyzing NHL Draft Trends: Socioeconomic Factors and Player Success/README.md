## 🔍 Overview
The NHL Draft is a game-changer for young players dreaming of an NHL career. But what factors influence their success? This project seeks to answer critical questions:

🏆 **How does a player’s pre-draft league impact their NHL career?**
   - Which leagues consistently produce NHL players?
   - Do certain leagues foster longer careers?
   - How do NHL stats (games played, points) differ by league?

🌍 **Do economic and demographic factors play a role?**
   - Are players from wealthier countries more successful?
   - Does population size impact NHL player production?

By analyzing draft data alongside socioeconomic indicators from the World Bank, we aim to unlock hidden insights into NHL scouting and development.
